        <h1>Gametogenesis</h1>
        <p1><b>Gametogenesis</b> is defined as the conversion of germ cells into male and female gametes (sex cells). It is process by which gametes or germ cells are produced in an organism, it involves developmental stages of male and female sex cells required to form a new individual.
         <h2>Processes in Gametogenesis</h2>   
         <p2>Gametogenesis involves two gamete development processes</p2>
         <OL>
             <li>Spermatogenesis in males</li>
             <li>Oogenesis in females</li>
         </OL>
         <p2>The sequence of gametogenesis is the same, but the timing of events during meiosis differs in the two sexes.</p2>
         <h2>Primordial Germ Cell</h2>
         <p2>Mature male and female germ cells are direct descendants of Primodial Germ Cell (PGC), which in human embryo appear in the wall of the yolk sac at the end of 3rd week of embryonic development. These cells migrate by ameboid movement towards the developing gonads. They arrive at the end of 4th week and the beginning of 5th week.

         <h3>Structure of Mature Spermatozoa</h3>
         <p2>A spermatozoon is a male sex cell (gamete) which is a highly specialized, free swimming and actively motile cell. A mature sperm cell is microscopic with a tadpole-shaped structure approximately 0.06 mm (60 μm) long.<br><br>Sperm cell consists of the following parts:</p2>
         <ol>
             <li>head</li>
             <li>Neck</li>
             <li>Middle piece and</li>
             <li>A Principal Piece or Tail</li>
         </ol>

         <br>
        <div class="pot"><p2><b>Head:</b> The head of the human spermatozoon is piriform in shape and measures 4 μrn in length. It has a compact nucleus with only chromatic substance and is surrounded by only a thin rim of cytoplasm. Above the nucleus lies a cap-like structure called the acrosome, which secretes the enzyme spermlysin that is necessary for fertilization. As the spermatozoon approaches the egg, it undergoes the acrosome reaction in which the membrane surrounding the acrosome fuses with the plasma membrane of the sperm's head, exposing the contents of the acrosome.
        <br><bR><b>Neck:</b> It is the smallest part, and has a proximal and distal centriole. In mature spermatozoon; the proximal centriole enters into the egg during fertilization and starts the first cleavage division of the egg, which has no centriole. The distal centriole gives rise to the axial filament which forms the tail.
         <br><br><b> Middle piece:</b> It has 10–14 spirals of mitochondria surrounding the axial filament in the cytoplasm. It provides cellular energy for motility, and hence is called the ‘powerhouse’ of the
        3
        sperm. It also has a ring-shaped annulus that form a diffusion barrier between the middle piece and the principal piece and serve as a stabilizing structure for tail rigidity.
        <br><br><b>Principal piece or Tail:</b> It is the longest part, having an axial filament surrounded by cytoplasm and plasma membrane, but at the end piece, the axial filament is naked.</p2>
         <h2>Spermatogenesis</h2>   
         <p2>Spermatogenesis is the sequence of events in the seminiferous tubules of the testes that leads to the production of spermatozoa. The Primordial Germ Cells (PGC) that migrate from the yolk sac to the testes during early embryonic development become stem cells, or spermatogonia, within the outer region of the seminiferous tubules. Spermatogonia are diploid (2n) cells (with 46 chromosomes) that give rise to mature haploid (1n) gametes by a process of reductive cell division called meiosis. In a human male, the formation of gametes (spermatozoa) takes place only during the reproductive period, which begins at the age of puberty (12 to 16 years) and continues even through old age. Spermatozoa are formed in the walls of the seminiferous tubules of the testes which can be referred to as germinal epithelium. Spermatozoon, at various stages of maturation are found there. Most of these represent stages in the formation of spermatozoa, but some (called Sertoli and Leydig cells) have only a supporting function.</p2>
         <h2>Cell-stages in Spermatogenesis</h2>
         <p2>The various cell-stages in spermatogenesis are as follows</p2>
         <ol>
             <li>The spermatogonia (type A) or germ cells (44 + X + Y) divide mitotically, to give rise to more spermatogonia of type A, and also to spermatogonia of type B</li>
             <li>The spermatogonia type B (44 + X + Y) enlarge, or undergo mitosis, to form primary spermatocytes.</li>
             <li>The primary spermatocytes {44 + X + Y) now divide so that each of them forms two secondary spermatocytes. This is the first meiotic division: it reduces the number of chromosomes to half.</li>
             <li>Each secondary spermatocyte has 22 + X or 22 + Y chromosomes. It divides to form two spermatids. This is the second meiotic division and this time there is no reduction in chromosome number.</li>   
             <li>Each spermatid (22 + X or 22 + Y) gradually change s its shape to become a spermatozoon. This process of cyto-transformation of a circular spermatid to a spermatozoon is called spermiogenesis.</li>
